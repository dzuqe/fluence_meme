# Fluence Gitcoin Quest:

1. What is Aquamarine?
- A transparent blue-green variety of beryl, used as a gemstone.
- An environment for EVM compatible smart contracts.
- Aqua manages the definition of workflows whereas marine is a wasm execution environment. [correct]

2. Fluence's business model entails:
- Fluence uses a tiered pricing model where there's free limited apps and priced full fledged apps.
- Each user pays a monthly subscription free to use an application and can cancel anytime.
- Developers can earn Fluence's native token from their software usage.  The network-wide licensing system maintains a global network of application dependencies, access rights, and pricing. [correct]

3. Which programming languages are supported by Fluence?
- All of them considering the runtime can install compilers for you to write apps.
- C++, Rust and any other language supported by the emcscripten wasm compiler. Marine is a wasm runtime so any language that compiles to wasm can execute on Marine.
- You state your workflows via composition of services in the Aqua language which gets compiled into an intermediate representation (AIR). This in turn is executed directly on AquaVM. Services are currently defined in Rust language (with a macro utility) or Typescript that compiles to wasm and is executed on MarineVM. [correct]

4. Do you need to connect your metamask wallet to use Fluence?
- Yes
- No [correct]
-  Depends on the application architecture.

5. Fluence's main beliefs are

- To implement a hybrid model of decentralization where oracles run on servers to feed on chain smart contracts data and with an identity protocol (ie Fluence) the two are married into one and all applications are presented by a facade.
- To disrupt traditional cloud platforms with a new open and decentralized runtime where you can host applications such as oracles, databases and random number generators. Existing web2 cloud code can be ported to Fluence. [correct]
- To rival against existing JavaScript web frameworks like React and svelte.
